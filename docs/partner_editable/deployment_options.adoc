This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, VPC endpoint, security groups, EFS, ECR, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys SageMaker into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions SageMaker in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure environment details, VPC, and SageMaker settings, as discussed later in this guide.
