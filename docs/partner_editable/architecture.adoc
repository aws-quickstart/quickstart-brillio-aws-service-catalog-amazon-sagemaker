.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/brillio-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS Lambda SageMakerBuild function for validating VPC Domain Name System (DNS) and provisioning SageMaker resources.
* AWS Service Catalog for triggering the SageMakerBuild function and passing parameters for creating resources.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, including: 
** End user role for accessing and launching the Service Catalog.
** Service Catalog launch constraint role for providing full permission to provision resources. 
** SageMaker execution role for providing limited access to the SageMaker notebook as determined by policies.
* In the private resource subnet:
** Amazon SageMaker for running ML models and workflow.
** Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for sharing common modules to SageMaker notebooks.
* In the private Elastic Network Interface (ENI) subnet, interface endpoints through which SageMaker communicates with the following AWS services:
** Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring of the SageMaker environment. 
** Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) with ECR Policy for storing the latest ML model images for future deployments.
** AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) for providing access to an IAM role to perform operations on other AWS services by assuming the role.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) gateway endpoint to access the S3 bucket for storing and retrieving ML data and bucket policy for restricting bucket access.
* A dedicated S3 bucket used as a data store for training models and SageMaker model artifacts.


// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
