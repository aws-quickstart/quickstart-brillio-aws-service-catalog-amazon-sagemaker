==== [OPTIONAL] Deploy {partner-product-short-name} as a Service Catalog Product.

. Once the base infrastructure is set up by cloudformation master template, Data Scientist/other user need to assume the IAM role (SCEndUserrole) or group got from CloudFormation output in previous step for launching service catalog product.
. Launch the SageMaker portfolio product.

NOTE: Specify the same environment name which is provided in Master template.

==== Test the deployment
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading
To test your deployment, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-console.html[Get Started with Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances and SDKs^].

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.
=== Access control
AWS IAM roles help to ensure that the compute resources (Lambda functions, SageMaker training clusters, and inference endpoints) can only access necessary Amazon S3 data and AWS resources.

=== Encryption 
All objects (data, models, and Lambda code) stored in Amazon S3 are AES-256 encrypted at rest using server-side encryption.

=== Private network
Using AWS VPC endpoints, API calls from SageMaker to other AWS Services like S3(Gateway), CloudWatch  will remain private and downloading packages over the internet is restricted. The network traffic remain within the AWS network and not accessible over the internet.

=== Isolation
Amazon SageMaker resources are saggregated based on the tags and are isolated from one another. The resources are grouped based on the principal and resource tags which are unique for every new deployments. Thus all resources are isolated from one another with the help of tags.


== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

_Add any other details that will help the customer use the software on AWS._
